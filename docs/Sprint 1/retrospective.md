# Retrospective Sprint 1

We mostly worked on the assignment thus our contributions to the code base were minimal.

The only MR that has was merged during this week was the one that adds the template and was performed by David.

We did not experience any difficulties during this week and thus we do not have any suggestions or adjustments for the next sprint.
