# Problems encountered

Here is a list of problems we encountered:

- Better communication for merge request reviews.
- Better communication on architecture.
- More contribution in assignemnt texts.
- We struggled with setting up the recursive relations in the certificates database.
- We had some problems with setting up the endpoints, microservice config, designing the functionality.
- We had some problems when using inheritance in JPA.
- We had problems with annotations.
