## Sprint 1 Retrospective
- we have submitted the draft for assignment 1
- we have created most of the microservices 
- we have created, assigned and labeled most of the issues

## W4 Plan

This week, we should focus on shaping the overall infrastructure of the project.

- finish creating all the entities we need 
- start implementing "must" features

## Discussion

- feedback from Matei on the architecture draft
- which features is everyone working on this week?
- make sure that for everyone the dependency of the issues is correct.
- see if anyone has encountered any problems last week
