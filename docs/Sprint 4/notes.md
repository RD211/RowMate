Info from Matei: 
Matei looked over our stuff and looked through the rubric and will inform us on how we’re doing. Matei shows us a rubric that says how we would be graded if right now is the deadline. It is advisable in the sprint retrospectives to type about the problems that we’ve encountered each week. Codestyle is excellent, listening to TA feedback is great. Good commenting in the git commits. We should test pairs of microservices working together (when relevant). Tooling and code reviews are good. This does not include the functionality of the code as that will be reviewed after the deadline. 
Reminder that we have the second part of Assignment 1 for friday. We have strategy and we’re considering builder and facade. We should motivate why we’re using those patterns in particular.


Testing requirements by hand by documenting that the user can do this, this and that. We should put that somewhere in the repository.
If we want points for edge testing we should have that included.


Questions And Answers:
Q: What should be in the retrospective?
A: Each retrospective should have problems encountered as a group, such as this was hard for the group this week. If we remember we should add the questions from last week’s too. 
Q: Should we only upload the second part of the assignment or both?
A: Only the second. We should have one to two pages per design pattern. Keep in mind the deadline is at 6pm and not midnight!
